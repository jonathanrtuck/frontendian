# applications

- Applicationâ€™s `index.ts` should only export an `ApplicationConfiguration` (from `/src/types`)
- Applications should be isolated. Thus, they must not import anything from this repo that exists outside of its own directory (other than types)
- Applications should use existing dependency packages (e.g. `react`) from this repo where possible
- Application components should use the received component props for rendering
  - `Content` for the main window content
  - `Menubar`, `Menuitem`, and `Menu` for an optional window menubar
