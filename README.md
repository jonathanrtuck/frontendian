This site was inspired by [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS).

## Tips

- Applications can be launched from the *frontendian* menu in the *Deskbar* (top right)
- Double-click *Desktop* icons to open certain files/applications
- Grab and drag the yellow window titlebar to move windows
  - Drag while holding `Shift` to move the titlebar along the window
    - This is useful for positioning "tabs" when multiple windows are zoomed (maximized)
- Grab and drag the bottom right corner of a window to resize
- Double-click a windowʼs titlebar to hide the window
  - Hidden windows can be shown again using the appliationʼs menu in the *Deskbar*
- Click the *Deskbar*ʼs clock to open a calendar

## Todo

- zoomed `Window` size/location
- prevent potential `TitleBar` position overflow on `Window` resize
- test `Menu` keyboard interaction
- combine `Menubar` and `Deskbar` components
- special resize handle for non-scrollable `Window`s in `beos` theme?
- support the other `Deskbar` layouts for `beos` theme?
- `mac-os-classic` theme
- different names for applications based on theme
  - e.g. *Tracker* vs *Finder*
  - use something like i18next?
- create a `README.md` for each theme
- update minor version
