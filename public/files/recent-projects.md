## [BankX](https://bankx.io/)

Redesign of the BankX website ([previous design](/images/bankx-before.png)) using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [web3](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/).

## [Mario](https://jonathanrtuck.github.io/mario/) ([Repo](https://github.com/jonathanrtuck/mario))

Recreation of World 1 Level 1 from [Super Mario Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) using [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas).

Everything was created from scratch using [bitmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) and [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Advanced_JavaScript_objects/Classes_in_JavaScript) for game entities.

It was an interesting challenge to figure out how to create a video game with no prior knowledge or research. I had to stumble through the implementation of a [game loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html) and physics, including [collision detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection), which required many rewrites.

The level is mostly playable. Although, enemies and items, such as coins, have not been added yet.
